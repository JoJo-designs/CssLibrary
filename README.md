# CssLibrary

## Goal

My goal is to make a css library that can be used for a range of things. I want to have separate files that can be used as needed. I don't know if this is a good idea but this is what I'm doing.

### reset.css 
Will reset the css that is automatically added by the browser.

### layout.css
Will have layout stuff, columns flex ect.

### element.css 
Will cover prebuilt elements like buttons ect.
